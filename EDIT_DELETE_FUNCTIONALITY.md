## Backend Implementation

### Enhanced PUT Endpoint
The package update endpoint now accepts multiple fields:
```typescript
router.put('/:id', authenticateToken, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Updates customer, packageType, dateSent, notes
  // Preserves trackingNumber, status, deliveryDate
  // Adds tracking history entry for the update
});
```

### Customer Deletion Endpoint
New endpoint for deleting all packages for a customer:
```typescript
router.delete('/customer/:customerName', authenticateToken, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Finds all packages for the customer
  // Deletes all packages and related data
  // Returns count of deleted packages
});
```

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Validation
- Required field validation
- Form validation before submission
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states during operations

### Server-Side Protection
- Authentication required for all operations
- User ownership verification
- Database error handling
- Detailed error logging

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Package Not Found**: When trying to edit/delete non-existent package
2. **Customer Not Found**: When trying to delete customer with no packages
3. **Permission Denied**: When trying to modify another user's data
4. **Validation Errors**: When required fields are missing or invalid

## Usage Instructions

### To Edit a Package:
1. Find the package in the dashboard
2. Click the "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" button
3. Modify the desired fields in the modal
4. Click "üíæ Save Changes" to update
5. Or click "üóëÔ∏è Delete Package" to remove the package

### To Delete a Customer:

2. Click the "üóëÔ∏è Delete Customer" button in the header
3. Read the warning information carefully
4. Type the exact customer name in the confirmation field
5. Click the delete button to proceed

## Best Practices

### Before Editing:
- Verify you're editing the correct package
- Double-check the tracking number (read-only) to confirm identity
- Consider the impact on delivery status and history

### Before Deleting:
- **Individual Packages**: Confirm you have the right package selected
- **Entire Customers**: Carefully review the package count and customer name
- **Backup Consideration**: Consider exporting data before bulk deletions
- **Team Coordination**: Communicate with team members about deletions

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication Required**: All edit/delete operations require valid user token
- **User Isolation**: Users can only modify their own packages
- **Audit Trail**: All modifications are logged in package history
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated on both client and server
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limits for delete operations

## Future Enhancements

2. **Undo Functionality**: Short-term undo for recent deletions
3. **Export Before Delete**: Automatic backup before customer deletion
4. **Advanced Permissions**: Role-based edit/delete permissions
5. **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive audit trail for all modifications
6. **Soft Delete**: Mark as deleted instead of permanent removal
7. **Batch Operations**: Delete multiple customers at once
